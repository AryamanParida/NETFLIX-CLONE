/*  SEE EARLIER WHEN WE DIDNT HAVE DIV CONTAINING THIS CLASS, WE DIDNT GET THE BACKGROUND IMAGE BUT NOW AFTER THIS WE GET BCOZ
 height property of the .loginscreen class was set to 100%, but since there was no parent container with a specified height, it resulted in the div element collapsing to a height of 0. Therefore, the background image was not visible. 
NOW WHEN WE GAVE another div with class loginscreen_gradient now 
IF WE GAVE IT height 100% then even now wewouldnt have gotten any image
the reason being the same as above
but when we give it height=100vh then size of container increases


IF U HAD JUST CHANGED height from 100% to 100vh in .loginscreen even then u would have got  the background image
 */

/* 
 the reason you were not getting the background image initially might be due to the lack of content inside the .loginscreen div. The .loginscreen_gradient div you added later helped bring the image into view. Here's what happened:

 Initially, the .loginscreen div had a height set to 100%, but without any content inside it. As a result, the div had a height of 0, and the background image wasn't visible.

 By adding the .loginscreen_gradient div inside the .loginscreen_background div and giving it a height of 100vh, you effectively provided content that occupies the entire height of the .loginscreen div. This caused the .loginscreen div to expand and display the background image.

The added .loginscreen_gradient div acts as a content placeholder and gives height to the .loginscreen div, allowing the background image to be visible. The width: 100%; and z-index: 1; properties you applied to .loginscreen_xyz ensure that it spans the entire width and is positioned above other elements in the stacking order (if any).

In summary, adding the .loginscreen_gradient div with a height property resolved the issue by providing content and allowing the background image to appear. */

        /* WHAT THIS DOES IS THAT IT STARTS FROM BOTTOM TO TOP IT GIVES 80% OPAQUE AT TOP AND AT BOTTOM AND AT 60% 
        
        
            The gradient is like a smooth transition of colors from the bottom to the top.
    The first color stop is at the bottom of the gradient and has a semi-transparent black color that is 80% opaque. This means it's a somewhat dark color but not completely solid, allowing some of the background to show through.
    The second color stop is positioned at 60% of the gradient's length. It is fully transparent, meaning it doesn't have any color. This creates a fade-out effect where the gradient becomes gradually more transparent as it progresses towards the middle.
    The third color stop is at the top of the gradient and has the same semi-transparent black color as the first color stop. It maintains the same level of transparency and darkness as the first color stop.*/
